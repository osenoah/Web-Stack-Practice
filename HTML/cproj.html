                    Proponents of this school of thought argue that philosophy should not compete with other disciplines but rather provide wise counsel and support their objectives. 
                    Phenix characterizes philosophy as the discipline that investigates and sets forth the relevance of knowledge in all its varieties to the human career. <br>
                    A well-ordered curriculum, which produces the necessary knowledge, skills, and morals in society, often draws from philosophical sources. 
                    The philosophical dimension of curriculum design involves metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics. <br>
                    A curriculum is considered descriptive when it projects certain values through an array of subjects in a school program. 
                    It is deemed programmatic when it outlines actions that encourage students to study specific subjects, aiming to modify their behavior and improve their outlook on life. <br>
                    Curriculum design represents a theory of pedagogical causation. According to Broudy, philosophical analysis and speculative synthesis can significantly influence the formulation and justification of curriculum theory. <br>

                        The speculative function of philosophy is widely accepted by analytic philosophers, unlike their empiricist counterparts who undermine the speculative nature of philosophy. 
                        Professor G. Smith defended the normative role of philosophy against Othaniel Smith, who argued, "it seems obvious that matters of fact are determined by observation.
                        " This debate illustrates the difference of opinion that characterizes the normative role of philosophy pursued through a speculative approach.
                        In summary, the speculative function of educational philosophy seeks to understand the nature of education, while the normative function aims to guide and improve educational practices.

                        The phenomenon you're referring to is called **parasitism**. Specifically, when nematodes reproduce within a mammalian host, they are engaging in a parasitic relationship. 
                        In this context, nematodes are parasites that rely on the mammal (the host) for survival, often causing harm to the host in the process. 
                        This type of life cycle is common in many parasitic nematodes that infect mammals, including humans. Yes, philosophy can indeed be considered a driving force behind ethics, analysis, logic, reasoning, belief, and various disciplines.
                        Philosophy provides the foundational frameworks and critical thinking methods that underpin these areas
